# RubberDucking Self Assessment (RDSA)

## Overview

The purpose of this document is to provide teams with the ability to continuously self-assess the health and compliance of their project throughout the development phase. Additionally it provides future developers with context into the maturity and compliance of the respective project. Ideally all standards should be complied with. In the case where they aren't, this document will serve as a point of reference for remediation.

### How to use this document?

Firstly this document (RDSA.md) should live in the root of all repositories where project-related work resides.  
Under the [**Checklist**](#checklist) heading you will find a list of SovTech standards and best practices presented in the form of questions.
Each standard/question should be marked according to the following key:

- 🟢 completed - the standard has been complied with
- 🔴 incomplete - the standard has **not** been complied with
- 🟡 not applicable - the standard is **not** applicable
- 🔵 recurring - the standard should be repeated each sprint

##### Assessment Method

This a self-assessment document, and should be updated periodically by all developers in the team, together. It is the responsibility of the team to ensure that this document is updated and that standards are complied with.
During each round of self-assessment, this document should be updated, a PR should be created and any relevant comments should be made in the PR by the team. For example, if the repo does not belong in the correct project on Bitbucket, it should be stated in the PR that a request to an admin has been made to move it.

##### Assessment Frequency

Self-assessments should be conducted frequently, at least once per sprint. The onus and accountability is on the team to ensure that this is kept up to date and complied with where applicable.
